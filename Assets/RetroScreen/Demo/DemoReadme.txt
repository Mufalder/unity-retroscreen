The Demo scene demonstrates the common use of the RetroScreen.

To better demonstrate the capabilities of this tool, there will be some demo scripts:
Rotation.cs - Rotates object around Y axis with specified speed.
DemoGUI.cs - Allows to change the RetroScreen parameters trough GUI.
DemoButton.cs - Prints text in the console.
FrameChangeAnchor.cs - Increments number every rendered frame.

To see FrameChangeAnchor in action, enable the "FrameChangeAnchor" object inside the "Main Camera" object(Which is also inside the "CameraAxis" object).
